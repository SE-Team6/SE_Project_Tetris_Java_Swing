# SeoulTech SE Course Team Project - Tetris reference code.

This code contains very basic implementation of Tetris game.   

Use it only for reference of how Java Swing and simple game logics work, if you don't know where to start.   
To implement the actual game, like you've seen in the demo, you need to chagne a lot for implementation.  
Hence, it would be better to start with your own code, and use this code as a hint. 

The code implements the following functionalities.  

- Create game screen with ```JFrame```.
- Implement simple ```KeyListener``` for player's input.
- Add ```Timer``` for dropping blocks.
- Default blocks of Tetris game.
- Basic game logics for block movement.
- Simple examples for changing styles.

Obviously, the current code is deliberately changed into a crude state, to prevent you from using it as your base code.   
For further funcionality implementations, you need to change the design and implementation a lot to make the code in better shape.  

--------------

**주의**
여기 제시된 코드는 Java Swing 및 어떻게 게임을 구현해야 할지 힌트를 주기 위한 것입니다.  
현재 디자인 및 구현은 앞으로 게임을 위한 다양한 기능을 구현하기에 적절한 상태가 아니니 단순한 참고용으로 사용하시기 바랍니다.
